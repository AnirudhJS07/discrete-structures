1. Write a Program to create a SET A and determine the cardinality of SET for an input array of
elements (repetition allowed) and perform the following operations on the SET: a) ismember (a,
A): check whether an element belongs to set or not and return value as true/false. b) powerset(A):
list all the elements of power set of A. 26

2. Create a class SET and take two sets as input from user to perform following SET Operations: a)
Subset: Check whether one set is a subset of other or not. b) Union and Intersection of two Sets. c)
Complement: Assume Universal Set as per the input elements from the user. d) Set Difference and
Symmetric Difference between two SETS e) Cartesian Product of Sets.

3. Create a class RELATION, use Matrix notation to represent a relation. Include functions to
check if the relation is Reflexive, Symmetric, Anti-symmetric and Transitive. Write a Program to
use this class.

4. Use the functions defined in Ques 3 to check whether the given relation is: a) Equivalent, or b)
Partial Order relation, or c) None

5. Write a Program to implement Bubble Sort. Find the number of comparisons during each pass
and display the intermediate result. Use the observed values to plot a graph to analyse the
complexity of algorithm.

6. Write a Program to implement Insertion Sort. Find the number of comparisons during each
pass and display the intermediate result. Use the observed values to plot a graph to analyse the
complexity of algorithm.

7. Write a Program that generates all the permutations of a given set of digits, with or without
repetition. (For example, if the given set is {1,2}, the permutations are 12 and 21). (One method is
given in Liu)

8. Write a Program to calculate Permutation and Combination for an input value n and r using
recursive formula of nCr and n Pr .

9. For any number n, write a program to list all the solutions of the equation x1 + x2 + x3 + …+
xn = C, where C is a constant (C<=10) and x1, x2,x3,…,xn are nonnegative integers using brute
force strategy.

10. Write a Program to accept the truth values of variables x and y, and print the truth table of
the following logical operations: a) Conjunction f) Exclusive NOR b) Disjunction g) Negation c)
Exclusive OR h) NAND d) Conditional i) NOR e) Bi-conditional

11. Write a Program to store a function (polynomial/exponential), and then evaluate the 27
polynomial. (For example store f(x) = 4n3 + 2n + 9 in an array and for a given value of n, say n = 5,
evaluate (i.e. compute the value of f(5)).

12. Write a Program to represent Graphs using the Adjacency Matrices and check if it is a
complete graph.

13. Write a Program to accept a directed graph G and compute the in-degree and out-degree of
each vertex.

14. Given a graph G, write a Program to find the number of paths of length n between the source
and destination entered by the user.

15. Given an adjacency matrix of a graph, write a program to check whether a given set of
vertices {v1,v2,v3.....,vk} forms an Euler path / Euler Circuit (for circuit assume vk=v1).

16. Given a full m-ary tree with i internal vertices, Write a Program to find the number of leaf
nodes.
